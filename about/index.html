  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to [Logic Soft](http://logicsoft.co.in)&#39;s engineering blog.

We have been a technology company since 1986. To put that into perspective, we have been around since **before** the Internet went mainstream. Our product helps hundreds of businesses get absolute control of their day to day activities. Chances are that if you&#39;ve walked into a recognized book store in India (or even some places abroad), then it has been powered by Logic Soft&#39;s software behind the scenes.

We&#39;re a bunch of hardworking individuals who believe that our work has an impact on the hundreds of clients that we serve. We believe in writing software that is readable and boring.
