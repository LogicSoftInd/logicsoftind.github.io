      <description>Sometime we have to do logging on Cookies for debugging in development site or in the production site. We had a situation like that,
In our big Web API that serves data to the android client. We used authentication for that client and server communication. authentication of app is based on uniquely generated Authentication token. It is happened automatically whenever the login required. One time we had an issue that is request from out client passes authentication for one request but failed for next request which is raised immediately after the first request to the same URI.</description>

      <description>Background After the recent dance with multiple Mono versions, the next step was to actually host the application.
Even though the app is largely still unfinished, I wanted to give it a shot on the staging instance to get a feel for things.
The general way to host apps on a Linux box is to have a NGINX reverse proxy in front, listening to different names on port 80 and to proxy the requests to internally running servers.</description>

      <description>Background Logic Soft&amp;rsquo;s primary application is a Windows based application written in C# using Windows.Forms. So when Microsoft announced ASP .NET 5 RC1, needless to say, we were quite excited.
We picked it up and started our experimentation - writing smaller applications and porting some of our side projects to the CoreCLR platform. As long as we didn&amp;rsquo;t go to the place that needed WIN32 APIs, it worked seamlessly.
With a small sum of experience, we took up the task of writing one of our internal dashboards with it.</description>
